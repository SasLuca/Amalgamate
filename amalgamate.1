.SH SYNOPSIS
amalgamate
[\-s]

[\-f {file|macro}]...
[\-p {file|macro}]...
[\-d {name}={file}]...
[\-i {dir}]...
{inputFile} {outputFile}
.SH DESCRIPTION
Produces an amalgamation of {inputFile} by replacing #include statements with
the contents of the file they refer to. This replacement will only occur if
the file was located in the same directory, or one of the additional include
paths added with the \fB\-i\fR option.

Files included in angle brackets (system includes) are only inlined if the
\fB\-s\fR option is specified.

If an #include line contains a macro instead of a string literal, the list
of definitions provided through the \fB\-d\fR option is consulted to convert the
macro into a string.

A file will only be inlined once, with subsequent #include lines for the same
file silently ignored, unless the \fB\-f\fR option is specified for the file.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Process #include lines containing angle brackets (i.e.
system includes). Normally these are not inlined.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR {wildcards}
Specify a comma separated list of file name patterns to
match when deciding to inline (assuming the file can be
located). The default setting is "*.cpp;*.c;*.h;*.mm;*.m".
.TP
\fB\-f\fR {file|macro}
Force reinclusion of the specified file or macro on
all appearances in #include lines.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR {file|macro}
Prevent reinclusion of the specified file or macro on
subsequent appearances in #include lines.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR {name}={file}
Use {file} for macro {name} if it appears in an #include
line.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR {dir}
Additionally look in the specified directory for files when
processing #include lines.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
Verbose output mode
